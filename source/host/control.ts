     Control.ts

     Requires globals.ts.

     Routines for the hardware simulation, NOT for our client OS itself.
     These are static because we are never going to instantiate them, because they represent the hardware.
     In this manner, it's A LITTLE BIT like a hypervisor, in that the Document environment inside a browser
     is the "bare metal" (so to speak) for which we write code that hosts our client OS.
     But that analogy only goes so far, and the lines are blurred, because we are using TypeScript/JavaScript
     in both the host and client environments.

     This (and other host/simulation scripts) is the only place that we should see "web" code, such as
     DOM manipulation and event handling, and so on.  (Index.html is -- obviously -- the only place for markup.)

     This code references page numbers in the text book:
